Starting with Signals:For handling signals,

Also, a way to handle signals could be like:- In accordance with handling interrupt and quit
signals,

By this approach, the process catches the signal only if the signal is not currently being ignored.
And then we have unreliable signals:By this we mean that signals could get lost: a signal could occur and the process would never
know about it. Also, a process had little control over a signal: a process could catch the signal or
ignore it. Sometimes, we would like to tell the kernel to block a signal: don’t ignore it, just
remember if it occurs, and tell us later when we’re ready.
