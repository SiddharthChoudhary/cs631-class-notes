There are basically three types of IPCs:
1. Semaphores
2. Shared-Memory
3. Message Queues
Note:- All of these are limited to process communication and are refferred to by an identifier and
a key
Message Queues:The good thing to note is:- message queues are identified by a named identifier and also that
the message queues may or may not be exposed in the file system
Then comes the PIPES:Pipes can be half duplex or full duplex
Pipes could be used further for process communication by communicating between parent and
child.
Mkfifo is used as a command line tool

Questions:
Can semaphores be mixed with shared memories?

Answers:- Turns out that yes they can be. Shared memory basically is built on top of
semaphores only.
